## Telegram Bot with ChatGPT Integration  

During my exploration of JavaScript, I wanted to experiment with **Node.js** and work with the **OpenAI API**. Since Telegram is my primary messenger and social network, it felt natural to create a bot that I could use myself and share with friends.  

### About the Project  
This bot is built on **Node.js** and integrates with **OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-Turbo model** via API. It can process both **text and voice messages**, maintaining conversation context until the session is restarted.  

### Technology & Features  
- Developed using **Node.js**  
- Works via OpenAI API on **GPT-3.5-Turbo**  
- Supports **text and voice message recognition**  
- **Remembers context** until the session is restarted  

### Why GPT-3.5-Turbo?  
While **GPT-3.5** is no longer the latest model, especially with the recent release of **GPT-4.5**, it remains a solid choice for handling high volumes of simple tasks. Unlike the newer, more expensive models, **GPT-3.5 is free within OpenAI's $5 monthly limit**, which I have never exceeded.  

Below is a screenshot of my usage statistics, showing that in a couple of weeks, I only spent **$0.40**, making this effectively a free solution:

### Demo  
Here’s an example conversation demonstrating **both text and voice processing**:
